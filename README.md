3D game made in Processing featuring interactive blocks

This was a project made in 24 hours for the SF CodeDay hackathon on 10/22/2013. 

It is a first person survival game set in a randomly generated world. Source code for the terrain can be found in the "terraingen" repository. The world contains primitive blocks that the player must gather and use to craft useful blocks.

Controls: WASD to move; F to turn off flying; LMB to move camera; and 1,2,3,4 for the tools. In the inventory, use Q to scroll, E to toggle selection, and C to craft using selected items in inventory. Selecting a tool in the inventory equips it.
